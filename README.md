# First 90 Days as Head of Architecture

Using [hugo](https://gohugp.io) I created an interactive walkthrough of the first 90 days for a new Head of Architecture.

This is hosted on GH pages using a [custom workflow](https://github.com/coderturtle/first-90-days/blob/main/.github/workflows/hugo.yaml) to build the hugo site and deploy to pages.

This is available at [First 90 Days](https://coderturtle.github.io/first-90-days/en/).
