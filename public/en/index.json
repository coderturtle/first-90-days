	"content": "The first step is to store your content in a secure and scalable way. A simple and flexible approach for static content that you want to make available on the internet is to store it in an Amazon S3 “bucket.” S3 is easy to set up and use, and is designed to store and retrieve any number of files or objects from anywhere on the internet. It’s simple to use and offers durable, highly available, and scalable data storage at low cost.\nWhen you put your content in an S3 bucket in the cloud, a lot of things become much easier. First, you don’t need to plan for and allocate a specific amount of storage space because S3 buckets scale automatically. In addition, because S3 is a serverless service, you don’t need to manage or patch servers that store files yourself; you just put and get your content. Finally, even if you require a server for your application (for example, because you have a dynamic application), the server can be smaller because it doesn’t have to handle requests for static content.\nHowever, lets take a look at the scenario shown in the following illustration. We’ve stored our content in an S3 bucket located in a region in Europe, and we have users located around the world who access that content. As the arrows show, whenever a user requests content, the request must go over the public internet to the source location–the S3 bucket in Europe. Depending on the user’s location, this can take a long time. The delays might even cause some user requests to bounce and return an error from the page.\nThis is where Cloudfront comes in\u0026hellip;\n"

Handily for domains registered through route53 we can use ACM to create the required cert.\nSign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/. Click Register Certificate Request a public cert Specify the domain names for the cert Add all subdomains required to the cert. For example domain.com, www.domain.com, *.domain.com. For a root domain like www.domain.com you will need both domain.com and www.domain.com on the cert.\nValidate you own the domain Choose how you wish to validate the domain. The easiest option is to use DNS validation. With this approach you need to add some DNS values to your route53 hosted zone. Add tags to the cert Review the cert details Validate the domain We chose earlier to validate the domain using the DNS method This is made super easy in the console as we are using route53. Expand each subdomain Click Create record in Route 53 The records are added for you Alternatively you can go into the hosted zone in Route53 and add the CNAME values yourself.\nWait for AWS to validate domain and issue the cert This can take up to 24 hours but normally happens in a couple of minutes.

	"content": "Storing your static content with S3 provides a lot of advantages. But to help optimize your application’s performance and security while effectively managing cost, you can also set up Amazon CloudFront to work with your S3 bucket to serve and protect the content. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can be more cost effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.\nCloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations. Using edge servers to cache and serve content improves performance by providing content closer to where viewers are located. CloudFront has edge servers in locations all around the world, as you can see from the following map:\nWhen a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location. If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront retrieves it from your origin – for example, the S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content. Then, for the next local request for the same content, it’s already cached nearby and can be served immediately.\nBy caching your content in Edge Locations, CloudFront reduces the load on your S3 bucket and helps ensure a faster response for your users when they request content.\nIn the following illustration, you can see that there are no longer requests traversing the globe to get to our content hosted in an S3 bucket. Instead, requests are routed to the “least latent” Edge Location; that is, the closest in terms of delivery speed. CloudFront then serves cached content quickly and directly to the requesting user nearby, as shown with the green arrows. If the content is not yet cached with an edge server, CloudFront retrieves it from the S3 bucket origin. And because the content traverses the AWS private network instead of the public internet and CloudFront optimizes the TCP handshake, the request and content return is still much faster than access across the public internet.\nBut how do we secure our content?\n"

	"content": "Often, companies that distribute content over the internet want to restrict access to documents, business data, media streams, or other content so that only selected users, like paying customers, can request it. By using CloudFront, we can set up additional access restrictions like geo-restrictions, signed URLs, and signed cookies, to further constrain access to the content following different criteria.\nAnother security feature of CloudFront is Origin Access Identity (OAI), which restricts access to an S3 bucket and its content to only CloudFront and operations it performs. The CloudFormation template in final section of this walkthrough includes OAI to help ensure that your content is protected and restricted.\nCloudFront includes additional protection against malicious exploits. To provide these safeguards, CloudFront integrates with both AWS WAF, a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, and AWS Shield, a managed DDoS protection service for web applications running on AWS. AWS WAF lets you control access to your content, based on conditions that you specify, such as IP addresses or the query string value on a content request. CloudFront then responds with either the requested content, if the conditions are met, or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). All CloudFront customers benefit from the automatic protection of AWS Shield Standard, at no additional charge. But customers who want deeper insights, enhanced mitigations, and cost protections against DDoS attacks can use AWS Shield Advanced.\n"
