### Subject: Follow-Up on Reactive Process Improvements Post-CrowdStrike Outage

Dear [Third Party Contact],

Thank you for outlining the proactive measures youâ€™re implementing to prevent similar issues in the future, including enhanced testing before updates are applied. To better understand how these enhancements will improve resilience, we would like to discuss any adjustments being made to your reactive processes to expedite response and remediation should a similar situation arise.

Could you provide details on the following:

1. **Improved Incident Detection and Response**:  
   - Are there any changes to your processes for detecting issues with critical systems more rapidly?
   - What modifications are being made to ensure a quicker initial response once an issue is detected?

2. **Enhanced Communication During Incidents**:  
   - How will communication with affected clients be improved to ensure timely updates from the moment an issue is identified through to its resolution?
   - Are you implementing any new protocols or channels for more frequent or structured updates?

3. **Coordination with CrowdStrike and Other Key Vendors**:  
   - How will you engage more closely with CrowdStrike or similar vendors during an incident to ensure prompt support and priority escalation?
   - Are there any new escalation pathways or coordination procedures being formalized to improve response times?

4. **Post-Incident Review and Process Adjustments**:  
   - Will there be any changes to the post-incident review process to ensure continuous improvement in incident handling?
   - Are there plans to conduct regular simulations or drills to test and refine your response capabilities under realistic conditions?

Understanding these changes will allow us to align our expectations and response protocols with your updated processes. Your insights will be invaluable as we continue to work together to strengthen our collective resilience.

Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your response.
