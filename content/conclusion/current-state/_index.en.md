## Executive Summary

This report provides a summary of the current state of architecture practices within [Company Name]. The review has highlighted several areas for improvement in standardization, governance, architectural oversight, and role definition. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for aligning our technology strategy with our business objectives, ensuring scalability, and positioning the architecture team as a strategic asset to the company.

## Key Findings

### 1. Lack of Consistent Standards for Documentation and Diagrams
- **Observation:** Architecture diagrams and documentation are created inconsistently across teams, resulting in varying formats, notations, and levels of detail. This inconsistency creates confusion and reduces the usability and effectiveness of these resources.
- **Impact:** The lack of standardized documentation hampers cross-functional collaboration, creates dependency on specific individuals, and makes it difficult for stakeholders to understand architecture decisions.
- **Recommendation:** Establish a set of standardized guidelines for all architectural diagrams and documentation. This should include templates, notation standards, and levels of detail required for various audiences (e.g., high-level overviews vs. detailed technical diagrams). Additionally, implementing a version control system for documentation can enhance accessibility and accuracy.

### 2. Insufficient Governance for Document Updates
- **Observation:** There is currently no formal governance or process to ensure that architecture documents and diagrams are kept up-to-date as systems evolve.
- **Impact:** Outdated documentation leads to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and increased risk in decision-making as architects, engineers, and stakeholders may be working with obsolete information.
- **Recommendation:** Introduce a documentation governance framework that mandates periodic reviews and updates. Assign ownership for each document, and implement reminders or triggers for updates based on changes to systems or structures. Consider adding architecture documentation updates as a deliverable in sprint cycles or project closeouts.

### 3. Architects Overly Engaged in Low-Level Work
- **Observation:** Architects are heavily involved in implementation details and low-level technical work, which reduces their capacity to take a strategic, holistic view of the architecture landscape.
- **Impact:** This focus on low-level work detracts from the architects’ ability to design, plan, and guide the architecture towards long-term goals and a cohesive target state.
- **Recommendation:** Realign the architecture team’s responsibilities by clearly distinguishing between architecture and engineering roles. Architects should focus on defining the target state, creating architectural roadmaps, and ensuring alignment with business objectives, while technical leads and engineers handle low-level design and implementation.

### 4. Lack of a Target State Architecture and Roadmap
- **Observation:** There is currently no well-defined target state architecture or roadmap that outlines a clear journey for the evolution of our systems and platforms.
- **Impact:** Without a target state and roadmap, architecture decisions may become reactive rather than strategic, leading to fragmented systems and higher technical debt. This also creates difficulties in aligning technical initiatives with long-term business goals.
- **Recommendation:** Develop a comprehensive target state architecture that aligns with the organization’s strategic objectives. This should include a phased roadmap detailing key milestones, dependencies, and initiatives required to reach the desired architecture. Regular review and adjustments will ensure that the roadmap remains relevant and achievable.

### 5. Need for Clear Definition of Roles and Responsibilities
- **Observation:** Roles and responsibilities within the architecture team and across related functions (e.g., engineering, product) are not clearly defined, leading to overlapping tasks and unclear ownership.
- **Impact:** This lack of clarity creates inefficiencies, potential gaps in accountability, and friction between teams, slowing down project delivery and creating confusion over decision-making authority.
- **Recommendation:** Define and document roles and responsibilities for each member of the architecture team and related stakeholders. Establish an RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix to clarify who is responsible for different areas of the architecture lifecycle, and communicate this structure across teams to facilitate alignment and accountability.

## Next Steps

1. **Establish a Working Group**: Form a working group consisting of representatives from architecture, engineering, and product management to define standards, documentation guidelines, and governance frameworks.
2. **Define a Documentation Governance Policy**: Develop a documentation policy that includes templates, review schedules, and ownership assignment to ensure up-to-date and accessible architectural resources.
3. **Develop a Target State Architecture and Roadmap**: Work with key stakeholders to draft a target state architecture that aligns with strategic business goals, and map out the journey to achieve it.
4. **Implement Role and Responsibility Clarifications**: Collaborate with HR and team leads to refine and clearly communicate the roles within the architecture team, ensuring everyone understands their responsibilities and accountabilities.

## Conclusion

The current state review highlights several critical areas for improvement in our architectural practices. By implementing consistent standards, establishing governance for documentation, defining roles more clearly, and developing a strategic roadmap, we can strengthen the architecture team’s effectiveness, enhance collaboration, and ensure that our architecture aligns with [Company Name]'s long-term vision. These initiatives will create a foundation for sustained innovation, agility, and scalability as we work toward a more robust and strategic architecture framework.
