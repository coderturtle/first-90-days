# Executive Proposal: Future Operating Model for the European DevOps Presence

## Executive Summary

The current international DevOps operating model—where a small team in Europe reports into a centralized, US-based Center of Excellence (CoE)—faces challenges. One European engineer is underperforming, reflecting a skillset misalignment. This has prompted US leadership to question the value of maintaining a European presence.

However, historical experience indicates that the absence of local DevOps support in Europe slows down international delivery teams. To address this, three potential paths forward are presented. Each option is examined with its advantages and potential downsides. While all three are viable, the recommended approach is to maintain and mature the European presence (Option 1). By hiring appropriately skilled DevOps talent, improving alignment with enterprise objectives, and proactively identifying improvements for the global organization, we can preserve the necessary responsiveness and expertise that the European teams rely on.

## Current Challenges

1. **Skills Misalignment:**  
   One of the two European engineers is on a performance improvement plan and lacks the DevOps-related skillset (e.g., CI/CD, infrastructure as code, automation) required to add value effectively.

2. **Limited Demonstration of Value:**  
   With half of the local team underperforming, it is difficult to showcase the true benefits of a regional DevOps presence to the US-based leadership. The friction over dedicating 20% of the team’s time to regional priorities has not yielded clearly visible enterprise benefits.

3. **Time Zone and Responsiveness Issues:**  
   Coordinating across time zones remains challenging. Historically, completely centralizing DevOps in the US resulted in slower responsiveness for UK delivery teams. Ensuring timely support and improvements is critical for international teams’ effectiveness.

## Proposed Future Operating Models

### Option 1: Retain and Mature the European Presence (Recommended)

**Description:**  
Continue maintaining a small European DevOps team within the US-led CoE. Backfill the underperforming engineer with a seasoned DevOps specialist. The European team would primarily work from the central US backlog, and any region-specific work would be clearly quantified and tied to enterprise-level OKRs. Additionally, the local engineers would spend dedicated time with UK delivery teams to identify pain points, feeding those insights back into the global pipeline for continuous enterprise-wide improvements.

**Advantages:**
- **Regional Expertise:**  
  Maintains proximity to European stakeholders, reducing delays and improving responsiveness.
- **Proactive Process Improvements:**  
  Engaging directly with UK teams uncovers inefficiencies and informs global best practices.
- **Enterprise Alignment:**  
  Mapping regional initiatives to core OKRs increases transparency and ensures the European presence supports the overarching enterprise mission.

**Potential Challenges:**
- **Hiring and Onboarding:**  
  Finding the right talent and ramping them up will require time and resources.
- **Continued Coordination Across Time Zones:**  
  Effective communication and workflow adjustments remain essential to integrate with the US CoE seamlessly.

### Option 2: Centralize All DevOps Capability in the US

**Description:**  
Remove the European DevOps headcount entirely and consolidate all functions in the US. To support international teams, define clear escalation paths, SLAs, and designated SMEs who can assist during UK hours, potentially through planned off-hour coverage.

**Advantages:**
- **Simplified Structure:**  
  A single team reduces complexity in communication and management.
- **Clear Enterprise Focus:**  
  All work directly aligns with US-led OKRs, eliminating disputes over local versus enterprise objectives.

**Potential Challenges:**
- **Reduced Regional Responsiveness:**  
  Past experience shows that lacking a local presence slows down response times for international teams.
- **Strain on US Team:**  
  Off-hour coverage and maintaining global responsiveness may increase the load and complexity on US-based engineers.

### Option 3: Devolve Full DevOps Functionality to International Offices (Not Recommended)

**Description:**  
Give international offices full control over their own DevOps operations. These teams could prioritize local needs and possibly choose their own tools and processes, independent of the enterprise CoE.

**Advantages:**
- **Local Autonomy:**  
  International teams gain full control, tailoring DevOps to their immediate requirements.
  
**Potential Challenges:**
- **Fragmentation of Standards:**  
  Diverging from enterprise tools and processes risks silos, complexity, and duplicated effort.
- **Reduced Enterprise Alignment:**  
  Focusing solely on regional needs may lead to misalignment with global strategies and standards.

## Recommendation

**Recommended Option: Option 1—Retain and Mature the European Presence.**

This approach balances the need for local expertise and responsiveness with enterprise-wide consistency and strategic goals. By hiring a properly skilled DevOps professional, clarifying measurable objectives, and fostering proactive communication, we can ensure that the European team adds demonstrable value to both local delivery and the broader organization.

## Next Steps

**0–3 Months:**
- **Talent Acquisition:**  
  Hire a DevOps engineer with the necessary CI/CD, automation, and infrastructure expertise.
- **Set Clear KPIs and OKRs:**  
  Define metrics linking European initiatives directly to enterprise goals, ensuring transparency and shared accountability.

**3–6 Months:**
- **Structured Engagement with UK Teams:**  
  Implement “office hours” and regular check-ins with delivery teams to identify improvements.
- **Periodic Performance Reviews:**  
  Assess whether European initiatives are reducing delays and improving enterprise-wide processes.

**6+ Months:**
- **Continuous Refinement:**  
  Adjust communication protocols, handoff processes, and skill development programs based on feedback.
- **Evaluate Impact:**  
  Measure improvements in time-to-deliver, incident resolution speed, and alignment with global standards. Consider scaling or adjusting resources as needed.

## Conclusion

By recommitting to a European DevOps presence and ensuring the right skillsets, clear governance, and direct engagement with delivery teams, we can uphold enterprise-wide consistency while enhancing regional responsiveness. This balanced approach addresses current challenges, leverages local expertise, and ultimately supports more efficient, high-quality delivery for the entire organization.
