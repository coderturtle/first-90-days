# Executive Proposal: Future Operating Model for the European DevOps Presence

## Executive Summary

The current international DevOps operating model—where a small team in Europe reports into a centralized, US-based Center of Excellence (CoE)—faces challenges. One European DevOps engineer is underperforming, creating doubts about maintaining a regional presence. US stakeholders have questioned the model’s efficiency, while historical precedent shows that eliminating local DevOps support can slow down international delivery teams.

However, additional European perspectives reveal that onboarding and integration with US-based teams can be difficult due to sparse documentation, tribal knowledge, and a lack of structured onboarding processes. European engineers often feel isolated and operate reactively rather than proactively engaging with local delivery teams. Addressing these issues can improve both regional effectiveness and enterprise-wide outcomes.

This proposal outlines three potential operating models and their associated upsides and challenges. While all three have merit, the recommended approach is to strengthen the European presence (Option 1). This involves securing properly skilled DevOps talent, improving onboarding and documentation, forging proactive relationships with local delivery teams, and ensuring that regional work clearly aligns with enterprise OKRs and delivers measurable value back to the core function.

## Current Challenges

1. **Skills Misalignment and Underperformance:**  
   One European engineer, currently on a performance improvement plan, lacks the requisite DevOps background (e.g., CI/CD, automation). This limits the regional team’s capacity to contribute effectively.

2. **Onboarding Complexity and Tribal Knowledge:**  
   New hires face a steep learning curve due to undocumented processes and reliance on tacit, US-centric knowledge. This slows down initial productivity and creates frustration for European engineers, who must spend disproportionate time deciphering unwritten rules and practices.

3. **Isolation and Limited Integration:**  
   European team members often work solo, feeling disconnected from both US counterparts and local delivery teams. Without structured touchpoints or proactive engagement strategies, the European DevOps presence becomes reactive, providing support on-demand rather than driving continuous improvements.

4. **Time Zone and Responsiveness Issues:**  
   While a European presence aims to reduce time-to-resolution for international stakeholders, current friction and lack of autonomy impede this goal. Past attempts to centralize fully in the US have led to slower delivery timelines for European teams.

## Proposed Future Operating Models

### Option 1: Retain and Mature the European Presence (Recommended)

**Description:**  
Maintain a small European DevOps team integrated into the US-led CoE. Replace the underperforming engineer with a skilled DevOps professional who can effectively manage CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and observability. Enhance onboarding processes with better documentation, structured mentoring, and regular knowledge-sharing sessions to reduce reliance on tribal knowledge. Implement proactive engagement models, where European engineers spend time with UK delivery teams identifying improvement opportunities. These opportunities, once translated into clear metrics, feed back into the global backlog—ensuring that the local presence drives measurable, enterprise-wide enhancements.

**Advantages:**
- **Regional Expertise and Responsiveness:**  
  Retaining local talent ensures quicker support and reduces delays for UK delivery teams, improving their productivity.
- **Improved Onboarding and Documentation:**  
  Addressing tribal knowledge issues by creating clear, accessible documentation and structured onboarding mitigates the initial productivity dip.
- **Proactive Engagement With Delivery Teams:**  
  Moving from reactive support to defined, proactive sessions with measurable outcomes fosters continuous improvement and stronger alignment with enterprise OKRs.
- **Clear Value Proposition:**  
  By quantifying the impact of local improvements (e.g., faster deployments, reduced downtime, efficiency gains in CI/CD pipelines), the European team’s contributions become transparent and justifiable.

**Potential Challenges:**
- **Upfront Investment in Onboarding and Training:**  
  Strengthening documentation, mentoring, and creating standardized onboarding materials requires initial effort and resource allocation.
- **Coordination Across Time Zones:**  
  Maintaining strong ties with the US CoE still demands careful scheduling and a culture of asynchronous communication.
- **Cultural and Operational Integration:**  
  Ensuring that the European team feels part of the broader organization may require intentional team-building and consistent interaction with US counterparts.

### Option 2: Centralize All DevOps Capability in the US

**Description:**  
Remove the European DevOps headcount entirely and concentrate all resources in the US. Any support for international teams would rely on well-defined escalation paths, SLAs, and potentially off-hours coverage by US engineers.

**Advantages:**
- **Unified Structure and Governance:**  
  A single, centralized team reduces managerial complexity.
- **Direct Alignment With Enterprise Objectives:**  
  All work streams and goals originate from and report into the US-based CoE, streamlining decision-making.

**Potential Challenges:**
- **Reduced Responsiveness for International Teams:**  
  Without a local presence, UK delivery teams risk slower response times and potential project delays.
- **Increased Burden on US Team:**  
  Covering multiple time zones and offering timely support may strain US engineers and require shifts or rotations, impacting morale.

### Option 3: Devolve Full DevOps Functionality to International Offices (Not Recommended)

**Description:**  
Grant international offices autonomy to run their own DevOps practices, tools, and processes. This local DevOps team would focus purely on international priorities and might diverge from enterprise tools and standards.

**Advantages:**
- **Local Autonomy and Customization:**  
  Delivery teams have immediate, dedicated DevOps support tailored to their specific needs.

**Potential Challenges:**
- **Fragmentation of Standards and Tooling:**  
  Operating outside the enterprise framework risks silos and added maintenance overhead.
- **Diminished Enterprise Alignment:**  
  Regional priorities may not align with global strategies, reducing synergy and efficiency.

## Recommendation

**Recommended Approach: Option 1—Retain and Mature the European Presence.**

By carefully selecting the right DevOps talent, improving documentation and onboarding, and developing a structured model for proactive engagement with UK delivery teams, the European DevOps presence can become a strategic asset. Aligning these local initiatives with enterprise OKRs will reassure US leadership that the European presence is both value-adding and accountable.

## Next Steps

**0–3 Months:**
- **Talent Acquisition and Onboarding Reform:**  
  Hire a DevOps specialist and develop clear onboarding materials and playbooks. Assign a US-based mentor to guide the new hire through enterprise tooling, processes, and frameworks.
- **Establish Baseline Metrics and KPIs:**  
  Define how local engagements with UK teams will be measured (e.g., time saved, pipeline efficiency gains, reduction in build failures).

**3–6 Months:**
- **Proactive Engagement Sessions:**  
  Schedule regular sessions with UK delivery teams to identify pain points and potential improvements. Translate findings into actionable backlog items tied to enterprise OKRs.
- **Documentation and Knowledge-Sharing:**  
  Continuously update documentation to reduce reliance on tribal knowledge, improving long-term scalability and resilience of the onboarding process.

**6+ Months:**
- **Performance Review and Continuous Improvement:**  
  Assess whether the local presence leads to faster resolution times, fewer deployment blockers, and higher overall DevOps maturity. Adjust team size, skillsets, or engagement models as needed.
- **Integration with US CoE:**  
  Strengthen cross-regional communication practices—utilizing asynchronous collaboration tools, regular knowledge transfer sessions, and continuous feedback loops to keep the team cohesive and aligned.

## Conclusion

Option 1 delivers the best balance of local responsiveness, enterprise alignment, and strategic flexibility. By investing in the right skills, improving documentation, enhancing onboarding, and shifting toward a more proactive, metrics-driven partnership with local delivery teams, the European DevOps presence can address current shortcomings and become a vital contributor to global engineering success.
