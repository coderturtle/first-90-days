---

#### **4. Data-Driven Architecture Decisions**
**Objective:**
- Enable evidence-based decision-making for architectural choices.

**Details:**
- Teach data collection and analysis techniques for architecture planning.
- Introduce metrics like response time, throughput, and error rates.

**Example (CloudCo):**
The CloudCo infrastructure team uses latency metrics to decide on migrating their database to a managed service.

---

#### **5. Architecture Governance**
**Objective:**
- Balance innovation with governance to maintain architectural consistency.

**Details:**
- Frameworks for lightweight governance in agile environments.
- Tools for monitoring compliance with architecture standards.

**Example (CloudCo):**
Teams implement a governance framework that mandates architecture reviews for all major changes, ensuring consistency across microservices.

---

### **Specialized Topics**

#### **1. Cybersecurity in Architecture**
**Objective:**
- Equip teams to design secure systems from the ground up.

**Details:**
- Cover principles like secure-by-design and zero trust.
- Simulate security breach scenarios and mitigation strategies.

**Example (CloudCo):**
The DevSecOps team runs a workshop on securing APIs, leading to the implementation of OAuth 2.0 across all services.

---

#### **2. Sustainability in Software Development**
**Objective:**
- Highlight environmentally sustainable practices in software design.

**Details:**
- Techniques for reducing energy consumption and carbon footprints.
- Metrics to measure sustainability impact.

**Example (CloudCo):**
Teams migrate an energy-intensive reporting service to a cloud provider with a renewable energy commitment.

---

#### **3. DevOps and Continuous Delivery**
**Objective:**
- Integrate architecture practices into DevOps pipelines.

**Details:**
- Focus on CI/CD best practices and automation.
- Implement architecture checks within the pipeline.

**Example (CloudCo):**
The engineering team automates architecture compliance checks using a CI/CD tool, reducing review times by 30%.

---

#### **4. Legacy System Modernization**
**Objective:**
- Strategize evolving legacy systems while minimizing disruptions.

**Details:**
- Frameworks for assessing modernization options (refactor, rebuild, replace).
- Hands-on exercises analyzing legacy systems.

**Example (CloudCo):**
Teams at CloudCo refactor a monolithic order management system into modular microservices, improving maintainability.

---

#### **5. Defining Product Lifecycles and Roadmaps for Retirement**
**Objective:**
