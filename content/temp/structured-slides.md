# **Architecture Vision & Strategy Presentation**

## **1. Team & Roles & Value**

### **Slide 1: Introduction to the Architecture Team**
- Who we are and what we do.
- Key business and technology alignment.

### **Slide 2: Architecture Team Roles**
- **Business Architects** – Aligning tech to business strategy, modeling ROI.
- **Technical Architects** – Scalable, cost-effective system design.
- **Solution Consultants** – Bridging business and technical requirements.

### **Slide 3: The Value of Architecture**
- How a well-structured architecture function drives business value.
- Examples of companies with strong architecture leading to success.

## **2. Architecture Practice**

### **Slide 4: What Good Architecture Looks Like**
- Scalability, resilience, modularity, and efficiency.
- Case study: **Netflix’s cloud-native transition**.

### **Slide 5: Establishing a Scalable Architecture Discipline**
- **Architecture Review Boards (ARBs)** for governance.
- **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** for transparency.
- Continuous training and improvement programs.

### **Slide 6: Experimentation & Proof of Concepts (PoCs)**
- Running controlled experiments to validate architecture.
- **Example:** Netflix's **Chaos Engineering**.

## **3. Current Problems**

### **Slide 7: Challenges in the Current State**
- Legacy dependencies.
- Technical debt and scalability bottlenecks.
- Slow feature development due to architecture constraints.

### **Slide 8: The Hidden Costs of Technical Debt**
- Operational costs, engineering inefficiency, and security risks.
- **Case Study:** Robinhood’s **trading platform outages** due to technical debt.

### **Slide 9: Case Study - Reducing Vendor Dependency**
- **Challenge:** Heavy reliance on a third-party platform (**XYZ**).
- **Problems:** High coupling, data inconsistencies, scalability concerns.

## **4. Future State**

### **Slide 10: Target Architecture Vision**
- API-first, event-driven, cloud-native architecture.
- Modular system design and service-oriented architecture.

### **Slide 11: The Road to Future Architecture**
- Breaking down **monolithic dependencies**.
- Enhancing **data ownership and governance**.
- Increasing engineering autonomy and speed.

### **Slide 12: Achieving Business & Tech Scalability**
- Future-ready platform design.
- Zero-trust security model.
- Data-driven decision-making and automation.

---

## **5. How We Get There**

### **Slide 13: A Phased Approach to Transformation**
- Step 1: Introduce **Integration Layers** (API gateways, abstraction layers).
- Step 2: Shift from vendor-managed to **internal data ownership**.
- Step 3: **Decouple UIs** with a domain service layer.

### **Slide 14: Managing Change Iteratively**
- Embed refactoring into product development.
- Prioritize technical debt reduction based on **ROI-driven impact analysis**.

### **Slide 15: Gradual Migration Strategy**
- Migrating features gradually instead of a **“big bang” migration**.
- **Example:** Netflix’s transition from third-party CDNs to **Open Connect**.

### **Slide 16: Summary & Next Steps**
- Recap of key takeaways.
- Actionable next steps for the architecture team.
- Aligning stakeholders on execution.
