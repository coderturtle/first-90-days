**b. Key Components:**
- **Maturity Levels:**
  - Define maturity levels (e.g., Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, Optimizing).
- **Assessment Criteria:**
  - Establish criteria for each maturity level, covering aspects like documentation, monitoring, scalability, security, and resilience.

#### 2. Develop the Maturity Model

**a. Criteria Development:**
- **Categories:**
  - Create detailed criteria for each category (e.g., Infrastructure, Application Development, Security, Operations).
- **Scoring System:**
  - Develop a scoring system to assess the maturity level of each service.

**b. Documentation:**
- **Guidelines:**
  - Provide comprehensive guidelines and examples for each maturity level and criteria.
- **Templates:**
  - Create templates for assessment reports and improvement plans.

#### 3. Conduct Initial Assessments

**a. Pilot Assessment:**
- **Select Services:**
  - Choose a few services to pilot the maturity assessment process.
- **Assessment Execution:**
  - Conduct assessments using the defined criteria and scoring system.

**b. Report and Feedback:**
- **Results:**
  - Document the results of the assessments.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Gather feedback from the teams involved to refine the process.

#### 4. Continuous Improvement

**a. Regular Assessments:**
- **Schedule:**
  - Establish a regular schedule for maturity assessments (e.g., quarterly or bi-annually).
- **Tracking:**
  - Track progress and improvements over time.

**b. Improvement Plans:**
- **Action Plans:**
  - Develop action plans to address areas of improvement identified in the assessments.
- **Resource Allocation:**
  - Allocate resources and support for implementing improvement plans.

| Resilience           | Reactive| Basic   | Defined SLAs | Performance Metrics   | Continuous Resilience Testing |

### Implementing a Tech Radar

#### 1. Establish the Tech Radar Framework

**a. Define Quadrants:**
- **Categories:**
  - Define quadrants/categories for the Tech Radar (e.g., Techniques, Tools, Platforms, Languages & Frameworks).

**b. Define Rings:**
- **Adoption Stages:**
  - Establish rings to represent different stages of adoption (e.g., Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold).

#### 2. Create the Tech Radar Process

**a. Technology Identification:**
- **Sources:**
  - Gather input from internal teams, industry reports, and research to identify relevant technologies.
- **Submission Process:**
  - Implement a process for team members to submit technologies for consideration.

**b. Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Assessment:**
  - Define criteria for evaluating technologies, including factors like business impact, technical feasibility, and risk.

#### 3. Populate the Tech Radar

**a. Initial Population:**
- **Current Technologies:**
  - Populate the Tech Radar with technologies currently in use at Gremlins Inc.
- **New Technologies:**
  - Add promising new technologies identified through the evaluation process.

**b. Regular Updates:**
- **Review Cycle:**
  - Establish a regular review cycle (e.g., quarterly) to update the Tech Radar.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Gather feedback from teams to continuously refine the radar.
