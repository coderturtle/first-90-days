![Scaling](images/scaling.png 'Scaling')

## Review & Refine Processes

- Conduct a thorough review of existing processes and workflows, identifying areas for improvement and implementing best practices to enhance efficiency and productivity.
- Introduce or refine metrics and KPIs to measure the success of the architecture team and ensure we are meeting our goals.

## Drive Innovation

- Begin exploring and piloting new technologies and methodologies that can bring long-term benefits to the organization. This could involve setting up innovation labs or initiating small proof-of-concept projects.
- Encourage a culture of continuous improvement and innovation within the team, fostering an environment where new ideas are welcomed and tested.

## Solidify Relationships & Foster Collaboration

- Continue to build strong relationships with key stakeholders, ensuring ongoing collaboration and alignment with business objectives.
- Promote cross-departmental initiatives to ensure that the architecture team is working effectively with other parts of the organization, such as product, operations, and business strategy.

## Strategic Alignment & Long-Term Vision

- By the end of the first 90 days, I would present a detailed roadmap for the next 6-12 months, including key projects, initiatives, and goals. This roadmap would be aligned with the overall strategic direction of the company.
- Ensure that the architecture team's efforts are clearly aligned with the companyâ€™s long-term vision, setting the stage for sustained success and growth.
