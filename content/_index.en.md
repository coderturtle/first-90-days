# Introduction

![Architecture](images/intro.png 'Head of Architecture')

As I step into the role of Head of Architecture, my primary focus will be on understanding the current landscape, building strong relationships with key stakeholders, and setting the foundation for strategic initiatives that align with our business objectives. With 17 years of experience in software engineering, architecture, and leadership, I am committed to leveraging my expertise to drive innovation, enhance system performance, and foster a collaborative and high-performing team environment.

My 30, 60, 90 day plan is structured to ensure a smooth transition, address immediate priorities, and lay the groundwork for long-term success. This phased approach will enable me to thoroughly assess the current state, formulate actionable strategies, and begin executing key projects that will drive both short-term and long-term value for the organization. 

The next sections lay out a breakdown of my approach.
